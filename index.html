Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, wanted to find the original source for Lorem Ipsum text. He looked up one of the more obscure Latin words from the passage: "consectetur". This helped him discover the original source.

It turns out Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet" comes from a line in section 1.10.32.

Note that the original text included some typos. (I suppose they didn't have spellcheck back in 45 BC.) Since this is a tradition, and very few people can even read Latin today, I've chosen to use the original version above that includes those typos, rather than one of the corrected versions.

Is lorem ipsum copyrighted?
No. It is public domain (copyright-free) so no one owns the rights to it. You can use Lorem Ipsum text freely.

Should I use a Lorem Ipsum Generator?
I personally don't bother with these. You can just use the original Lorem Ipsum text.

Some design tools may already have Lorem Ipsum text built-in, and you can just use those.
